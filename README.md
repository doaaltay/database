database.c - works for all methods except creating a new data type, binary format is implemented

databasemvp.c - mvp program for the project

databasenew.c- I tried to change my implementation of structs to a table implementation.
Works for search and add, update also works but spacing is wrong. This program also creates tables, which was
the only thing I couldn't implement in database.c. 

I would implement delete and update functions the way they are in my database.c, my update works but the spacing is of 
by 1 or 2 spaces, which I couldn't figure out why. For delete, I would implement sth very similar to the delete function in database.c, which deletes the line and iterates the next data to replace it
